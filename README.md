# Live-Project

## Introduction

For the last two weeks of my time at tech academy, I worked with my peers in a team devloping a full scale website with indudual apps for diffrent hobiests in python using django framework.Working on the Pycharm IDE was a great learning oppurtunity for fixing bugs, cleaning up code, and adding new features.I saw how a good developer works with what they have to make a quality product. I worked on several back end stories that I am very proud of. Because much of the site had already been built, there were also a good deal of front end stories and UX improvements that needed to be completed, all of varying degrees of difficulty. Everyone on the team had a chance to work on front end and back end stories. Over the two week sprint I also had the opportunity to work on some other project management and team programming skills that I'm confident I will use again and again on future projects.

Below are descriptions of the stories I worked on along with code snippets.

## Back end stories

- Weather REST api

- Beautiful soup libary for quotes

###### Weather REST api
This app had an api using json to display the weather and allowed you the capability to save the api of the weather.My task was to connect the api to a weather page and give it the capability to save it along with the date it was saved.

I also had to make a function so that it could save the api along with the date.

###### Beautiful soup libary
This app had an beautiful soup function that pulled quotes from a travel website by using webscraping and parsing.So that whenever you clicked on the beautful soup link there was a different quote about travling.

## Front end stories

- CRUD functionality


- Url Routing

###### CRUD functionality
This app had the capbility to create a entry for a desitnatiobn you've always wanted to go to.As well as the capbility to update the entry by either adding a description, deleteing it and then viewing your saved destination.

###### Url Routing
This app used url routing by using url paths to connect the main project to the app.and mapping urls to views.So all the pages rendered on the main website

## Other skills learned

- Working with a group of developers to identify front and back end bugs to the improve usability of an application

- Improving project flow by communicating about who needs to check out which files for their current story

- Learning new efficiencies from other developers by observing their workflow and asking questions

- Practice with team programming/pair programming when one developer runs into a bug they cannot solve
